## Project Overview

A static photo gallery built with a custom Python static site generator,
using AlpineJS for frontend interactions and
Tailwind CSS for styling.
Photos are processed with human-readable chronological filenames derived from EXIF data and
hosted on Hetzner object storage with BunnyCDN for global distribution.

### Conventions of Project

This is going for a django style settings, command and layout structure.
But we're also trying to find
a middle ground between django and FastAPI conventions.
In particular with functional paradigms,
like @click decorated commands for example.
Because this line between conventions is blurry, please ask.

### Priority

Speed of development and deployment over feature richness.
Get a working, acceptable user experience deployed quickly.

## Stack & Workflow Overview

### Technology Stack

- **Static Site Generator**: Custom Python generator with Jinja2 (Python 3.12)
- **Frontend**: AlpineJS + Tailwind CSS (CDN, no build step)
- **Photo Processing**: Python with Pillow, exifread
- **Storage**: Hetzner object storage (private + public buckets)
- **CDN**: BunnyCDN with Hetzner as origin
- **Development**: Local build -> Hetzner deployment
- **Package Management**: uv (Python package manager)
- **Testing**: pytest with `uv run pytest` command

### Photo Processing Workflow

```txt
Photographer's Photos -> EXIF Extraction -> Chronological Filename Generation ->
-> Thumbnail Creation -> Upload to Buckets ->
-> Custom HTML Generation -> Deploy
```

### Photo Organization Structure

```txt
Private Bucket (Hetzner):     Public Bucket (Hetzner):        Static Site:
/originals/                   /galleria-wedding/              Gallery page with:
  IMG_001.jpg                   {filename}.jpg  (full)         - Thumbnail grid
  IMG_002.jpg                   {filename}.jpg  (web)          - Infinite scroll
  ...                           {filename}.webp (thumb)        - Multi-select downloads
```

### Storage Strategy

- **Private Hetzner Bucket**: Original photos with authentication (personal archive)
- **Public Hetzner Bucket**: Full + web + thumbnail versions (for static site)
- **BunnyCDN**: Global CDN caching content from public Hetzner bucket

### Command Workflow & Sequence

The project follows a simplified workflow for processing and deploying the photo gallery:

```txt
Original Photos (PIC_SOURCE_PATH_FULL + PIC_SOURCE_PATH_WEB)
    ↓ [process-photos] 
Processed Photos (prod/pics)
    ↓ [build]
Static Site (OUTPUT_DIR)
    ↓ [deploy] 
Single S3 Bucket (photos + HTML + CSS + JS)
    ↓
Live Website
```

#### Command Overview

1. **`process-photos`** - Photo processing pipeline
   - Reads original photos from `PIC_SOURCE_PATH_FULL`
   - Reads web-optimized photos from `PIC_SOURCE_PATH_WEB` 
   - Extracts EXIF data and generates chronological filenames
   - Creates thumbnails (400x400 WebP) from web versions
   - Validates filename consistency between full and web collections
   - Outputs to `prod/pics` with structure:
     ```
     processed-photos/
       full/     (symlinks to originals with chronological names)
       web/      (symlinks to photographer's web-optimized versions)
       thumb/    (WebP thumbnails generated from web versions)
     ```

2. **`build`** - Static site generation  
   - Generates JSON metadata from processed photos
   - Creates static HTML using Jinja2 templates
   - Copies static assets (CSS/JS)
   - Outputs complete site to `OUTPUT_DIR`

3. **`deploy`** - Complete site deployment
   - Idempotently uploads entire site to single S3 bucket:
     - Photos (full/web/thumb) to `/photos/` prefix
     - Static site files (HTML/CSS/JS) to bucket root
     - JSON metadata for gallery functionality
   - Skips already uploaded files for efficiency
   - Supports dry-run and progress tracking
   - Handles CDN cache invalidation if needed

#### Usage Patterns

```bash
# Full pipeline for new gallery
python manage.py process-photos
python manage.py build  
python manage.py deploy --progress

# Development workflow
python manage.py process-photos --source ./test-photos
python manage.py build --dev-mode
python manage.py deploy --dry-run

# Quick site update (photos already processed)
python manage.py build
python manage.py deploy
```

**Note**: Commands are designed to be idempotent - running them multiple times is safe. The `deploy` command handles all upload operations to maintain consistency.

## Development Tasks & Specifications

### Static Site Generation **[COMPLETED]**

**Deliverable**: Static HTML gallery with complete functionality

See `doc/architecture/static-site-generation.md` for implementation details.


---

### EXIF Timestamp Correction **[NEXT PRIORITY]**

**Deliverable**: Timezone correction system for camera clock errors

#### Problem Identified
- Camera EXIF shows `+00:00` (UTC) timezone but timestamps are 4 hours ahead of expected UTC
- Ceremony at 4:00 PM Swedish time (UTC+2) should be 2:00 PM UTC, but photos show 6:10 PM
- All 645 photos have systematic 4-hour offset from expected UTC timing

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Settings-based offset**: Add `TIMESTAMP_OFFSET_HOURS` setting (e.g., `-4` hours)
- [ ] **Processing integration**: Apply offset during `process-photos` command
- [ ] **EXIF correction**: Modify EXIF data in production bucket copies
  - Correct `DateTimeOriginal` to proper UTC time
  - Set `OffsetTimeOriginal` to actual Swedish timezone (`+02:00`)
  - Preserve original archive files (read-only)
- [ ] **Upload detection**: Deploy command detects EXIF changes and re-uploads
- [ ] **CDN invalidation**: Trigger cache refresh when photos change
- [ ] **Documentation**: Log corrections applied for transparency

#### Implementation Plan
1. Add timezone offset setting to process-photos workflow
2. Integrate EXIF correction into production bucket upload
3. Test upload change detection and CDN invalidation
4. Validate corrected timestamps work in external photo management software

4. Copy static assets (CSS, JS, images)
5. Generate sitemap.xml
6. Create deployment manifest

##### upload-photos Command

See "Upload to Public Gallery Bucket" section above for details.

##### deploy Command

**Purpose**: Deploy complete gallery (photos + static site) to production hosting

**CLI Options**:
- `--source`, `-s`: Override OUTPUT_DIR
- `--dry-run`: Show deployment plan without executing
- `--invalidate-cdn`: Trigger CDN cache purge
- `--photos-only`: Upload only photos/metadata (skip static site)
- `--site-only`: Upload only static site files (skip photos)

**Storage Architecture**:

  - `/photos/thumb/` - WebP thumbnails
  - `/metadata.json` - Photo metadata with corrected timestamps
  - `/index.html`, `/gallery.html` - Static site files

**Architecture Plan**:
- **Service Layer**: Create reusable `deploy_directory_to_s3()` function
  - Takes source dir, bucket, prefix, options
  - Handles S3 logic, progress, dry-run, error handling
  - Returns detailed upload results
- **Commands**:
  - `upload-photos`: Simple wrapper around service function for prod/pics → photos/ prefix
  - `deploy`: Comprehensive wrapper - calls service function for both photos AND static site files
- **Smart Detection**: Add in future iteration after initial deployment
  - Compare local file checksums vs S3 ETags
  - Only upload changed files
  - Track deployment state in metadata

**Deployment Steps**:
1. Call `deploy_directory_to_s3()` for photos (if not --site-only)
2. Call `deploy_directory_to_s3()` for static site files (if not --photos-only)
3. Trigger CDN cache invalidation (if --invalidate-cdn)

### Performance Optimization

- **Lazy loading**: Progressive image loading optimization
- **CDN optimization**: Advanced BunnyCDN configuration for better global performance
- **Compression**: Additional image optimization techniques

## Filename Format Analysis

### UUID vs Human-Readable Comparison

**UUIDv7 Approach (Discarded):**

- 26 characters (Base32 encoded)
- Abstract, not human-readable
- Over-engineered for wedding photo scale
- Complex implementation (~100+ lines)
- Designed for distributed systems with billions of IDs

**Human-Readable Timestamps (Selected):**

- ~35 characters but human-readable
- Instant chronological understanding
- GPS-based timezone context
- Simple implementation (~30 lines)
- Perfect for wedding-scale collections

**Decision Rationale:**
Human-readable filenames chosen because they provide immediate temporal context, sort chronologically in any file browser, and are much simpler to implement and debug. The slight length increase is offset by the massive usability improvement.

### Developer Tools (Deprioritized)

#### list-samples Command

**Status**: Deprioritized - find-samples already provides needed functionality

Originally planned to display saved sample metadata from JSON cache. However, find-samples 
already shows all necessary information when run, and the JSON output is primarily useful
for debugging. The command structure and edge case detection from find-samples proved more
valuable as building blocks for chronological UUID generation than as a standalone tool.

---

## Deploy Command Improvements **[POST-DEPLOYMENT]**

**Current Issues with Deploy Command UX**:

**Tasks for Future Optimization**:
- [ ] **Split setup-cors into standalone command** - Deploy should fail and cite invalid CORS configuration, user should run dedicated setup-cors command
- [ ] **Add progress reporting to deploy command** - User should see real-time upload progress, not be in the dark about what's happening
- [ ] **Improve deploy output clarity** - Clearly distinguish between files being updated vs skipped due to no changes needed
- [ ] **Test deploy command idempotency** - Verify running deploy multiple times with no changes behaves correctly and shows appropriate "no changes" messaging

---

*This specification prioritizes rapid deployment of core functionality. Features marked as "Future" can be implemented in subsequent iterations after the initial gallery is live and functional.*
